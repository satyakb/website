          //- | You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
          | Hello, my name is Satya Bodduluri. I am a 20 year old student from Palo Alto, CA, but I study Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I like to make cool things.
